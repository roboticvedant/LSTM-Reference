# Time Series Prediction with LSTM Networks

## Understanding LSTM Networks

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies. LSTMs are particularly useful for time series prediction because they can remember information for long periods. This is achieved through their unique structure, which includes memory cells and three types of gates:

- **Forget Gate:** Decides what information should be discarded from the cell state.
- **Input Gate:** Updates the cell state with new information from the current input.
- **Output Gate:** Determines the next hidden state and output based on the current input and the memory of the cell.

These gates allow the LSTM to selectively remember or forget patterns over time, making it adept at handling sequences of data, such as time series.

## Example Functions for Time Series Prediction

To apply LSTMs to time series prediction, we typically preprocess the data into a suitable format, define the LSTM model architecture, train the model, and then make predictions. Below are example functions that illustrate this process using TensorFlow and Keras.

### Data Preprocessing

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def df_to_X_y(df, window_size=5):
  df_as_np = df.to_numpy()
  X = []
  y = []
  for i in range(len(df_as_np)-window_size):
    row = [r for r in df_as_np[i:i+window_size]]
    X.append(row])
    label = df_as_np[i+window_size] [0]
    y.append(label)
  return np.array(X), np.array(y)
```

This function converts a DataFrame into a format suitable for training LSTM models, where `X` is the input sequence and `y` is the output or target.

### Defining the LSTM Model

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

def build_lstm_model(input_shape):
  model = Sequential([
    LSTM(64, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
    Dense(1)
  ])
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
  return model
```

This function defines a simple LSTM model with one LSTM layer followed by a Dense layer for prediction. The model uses the mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer.

### Training the Model

Once the data is preprocessed and the model is defined, you can train the model using the `model.fit()` function in Keras, passing in the input and output sequences, the number of epochs, and any callbacks as needed.

### Making Predictions

After training, you can use the `model.predict()` method to make predictions on new data.

## Conclusion

LSTMs offer a powerful way to model and predict time series data by effectively capturing long-term dependencies. By preprocessing your data, defining an LSTM model, and training it on your dataset, you can leverage LSTMs for a wide range of time series forecasting tasks.
## Application: Predicting Machine/Subsystem Breakdown
---
My interest in time series prediction, particularly through the lens of LSTM networks, stems from a profound appreciation for its potential to predict machine or subsystem breakdowns, such as in automotive systems. 
By selecting features informed by the physics and engineering of the system, and training the model on these carefully chosen inputs, we can significantly enhance the model's predictive accuracy. 

This approach allows for the early detection of potential failures, facilitating timely maintenance and avoiding catastrophic failures.
The notebook aims to provide a solid foundation for those interested in leveraging LSTM networks for such predictive tasks. Through a combination of theory and practical examples, it equips readers with the knowledge 
to implement LSTM-based forecasting for various applications, including but not limited to predictive maintenance in automotive systems.
